# AI-Practical-Homework
Welcome to the repository for practical homework assignments of the Artificial Intelligence course offered at Sharif University of Technology in Fall 2023, instructed by Professor Dr. Rohban.

Homework Assignments Overview:
Homework 1: Search Algorithms

Implement and analyze various search algorithms to solve problems efficiently, exploring strategies such as depth-first search, breadth-first search, and A* search.
Homework 2: Constraint Satisfaction Problem & Adversarial Search

Dive into constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) and adversarial search techniques, applying algorithms like backtracking and min-max with alpha-beta pruning to solve challenging scenarios.
Homework 3: Reinforcement Learning (RL)

Explore the fundamentals of reinforcement learning, designing agents to learn optimal behaviors through interaction with an environment, and implementing algorithms like Q-learning or Deep Q Networks (DQN).
Homework 4: Bayes Inference & Hidden Markov Models (HMM)

Delve into probabilistic reasoning with Bayes inference, applying it to solve real-world problems. Additionally, study Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and their applications in sequence prediction tasks.
Homework 5: Machine Learning (ML) - Regression & Bias-Variance Trade-off

Investigate regression techniques in machine learning, understanding the trade-off between bias and variance, and implementing regression models to analyze and interpret data effectively.
