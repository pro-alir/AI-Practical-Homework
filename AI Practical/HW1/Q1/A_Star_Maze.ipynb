In this project, many simulation engines was created in the ground where sensory data from the spacecraft was sent to simulation devices. The model would then update itself with this data and send response or action commands back to the spacecraft using advanced telecommunication protocols. This concept has recently gained popularity.\n",

Additionally, there is a [TEDx](https://www.ted.com/talks/karen_willcox_how_digital_twins_could_help_us_predict_the_future?language=en) talk dedicated to this concept that you may find interesting."

However, BFS explored much fewer number of blocks and finished faster, But we know that it uses a lot of memory (and DFS uses less memory). In IDS code, every time we add 40 to depth limit which should be 1 but that takes a lot of time. Even with adding 40 to depth limit, IDS tooks 28 s to finish (more than the others) and it explored 405 blocks which is almost half of DFS and a bit more that BFS. If we had 2 destination points, BFS could find the optimal one, But DFS could find the non optimal solution. IDS would fined the optimal solution if we update depth limit by 1 (in the code depth limit is 40, in this case it may find the non optimal solution)  \n"
